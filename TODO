TODO list
* User interface 
- Pre-game settings (boar-size, difficulty, pieces, allow pause in
  network, ...)
- In-game settings (music, binds, cpu/human toggle, ...)  => No more
  messing around in-game!
- Put splitscreen two player in one pane
- Fix menu and sound
- Add some generic binds (q = quit, etc)
- Secret debug/cheat commandline
* Bugs
- Very long games crash without reason
- Holding a button is not very responsive
- Start pieces not adjusted to settings, may be from wrong set
- CPU / Human toggle unpauses game and destroyes boardsize setting
- Problems with pause toggle, also the bind "P" sometimes doesn't work

* Plan
- game is running?
  - grey out options
- initial start
  - change pause to start (logic)
